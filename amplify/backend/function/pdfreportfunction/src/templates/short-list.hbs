                    The Client has requested a report on the value of the Property only.  The Report is not a more thorough RICS Homebuyer Report, Building Survey or other detailed survey report. The Surveyor will draw attention to the general condition of the property and any visible major defects but only where these may have an effect upon the Valuation.

                <span>
                    External Cladding Panels - Composite external panels which incorporate insulating material between inner and outer external wall faces such as aluminium composite material (ACM) panels have been extensively used in recent years as external cladding. Some panel cladding systems incorporate combustible insulation materials. The type of insulation and any fire checking of the panel system cannot be identified from a visual inspection. Where the existence of such panels has been reported, the type of insulation and installation is outside the scope of this Valuation report. For buildings of more than six storeys it is essential that the Fire Safety Certificate, (EWS1) is supplied; where the nature of the cladding is considered to be suspect the Surveyor will report a Zero Value until the EWS1 in Compliance is supplied. For buildings of six storey height or less the Surveyor will make the assumption that the cladding system is satisfactory. It is the responsibility of the client to have any materials tested and if found to be not in compliance the valuation may then require to be adjusted. Clients should make all necessary enquiry prior to any legal or financial commitment.

                    Asbestos and other hazardous materials: The construction of buildings, fixtures, fittings and plant or equipment may contain hazardous materials.

                    (c) that the state of the market, levels of value and other circumstances were, on any earlier assumed date of entering into an agreement for lease, the same as on the date of valuation;
